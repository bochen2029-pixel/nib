# nib — development log

## 2026-09-03 · the blueprint

- The idea arrived in three moves. First: a native Notepad++-shaped editor doing Etherpad-style
  real-time editing, auto-discovering peers on the LAN, no browser, no configuration. Second:
  rooms — anyone hosts, discoverable or invited, passphrase-gated — plus an optional local LLM as
  watcher, moderator or contributor. Third, the twist that reorders everything: Etherpad is
  granular enough that it is already not turn-based, FUSOR streams natively in both directions,
  and so the two fit without an adapter.
- The diagnosis that set the build order: Etherpad failed as a MATCHING problem, not a technical
  one. Its value needed two people free at the same instant. A resident is the first thing that is
  always free, so the resident half carries the whole thesis and the LAN half is upside. Act I is
  one person, one pad, one resident, no network at all.
- The sharpest formulation, the operators: the interaction IS the prompt. A system prompt is an
  artifact of amnesia; you have never handed a colleague one. Purpose stays owner-set per FUSORs
  law that it is imported and never learned, but subject and context accrete from the writing.
- The livability answer, also the operators: two switches. AI on/off, and resident/turn-based.
  The second is worth more than livability - it is the twin race instrumented in the product, one
  paired sample per flip, provided the seat, seed and sampler stay identical across it.
- Named as the research problem rather than a detail: FLOOR CONTROL. The emit gate decides whether
  to speak; nothing yet decides where the words land and when, in a buffer someone else is typing
  into. No prior art - nobody has had to solve it for an entity with no turns sharing a surface
  with humans who also have no turns.
- The demonstration is un-saying, made visible. In a chat box it is impossible or looks like a bug.
  In a pad it is an ordinary event the surface already renders, and it needs no narration.
- Decided on day one to avoid a rewrite: the document is an op log with stable character
  identities even with one user, because Act II swaps the serializer and not the model.
- Next: Stage 0 per BLUEPRINT section 8 - the editor with no model in the process, and an op log
  that replays byte-exact.

## 2026-09-03 (later) · the assembly correction

- The operator pointed out that Etherpad is on this box (C:/etherpad-develop) and that C:/auricle
  already builds a resident that ingests a live stream and projects words on screen. Both of my
  earlier recommendations priced work that does not need doing. docs/ASSEMBLY.md supersedes
  BLUEPRINT sections 2 and 7 where they disagree.
- CORRECTION ONE. Etherpad is Node/TypeScript, so "wrap it in a C++ client" is three projects, not
  one. Bundling node.exe plus a localhost server kills the no-network-stack law on day one and
  still leaves the client implementing changeset apply/compose. Porting Changeset.ts and its half
  dozen companions (about 1,500 lines, stable format, golden vectors in the repo) is REUSING the
  wheel: same algorithm, same wire format, same tests, in the language the client already speaks.
- CORRECTION TWO. I recommended CRDT before seeing this box. That priced the wrong thing: CRDT
  costs designing and verifying something new, and Etherpad OT is already verified and sitting on
  the disk. Take OT with a serializer per document - free in Act I (one machine IS the server),
  a room host in Act II, with pad handoff rather than leader election. The cost is honest and
  recorded: a room needs its host, against my earlier claim that it would survive the host
  leaving. If that proves intolerable in Act II, CRDT is still there, paid for by a measurement.
- THE SEAM ALREADY EXISTS. src/fusor/source.h defines StreamingTextSource, Delta and the SPSC
  ring, with FileTailSource as the worked example. PadSource is one more implementation, about
  150 lines. The file also states three constraints I would have hit the hard way: self-echo
  (spec 5.8) - a delta whose lane is one of FUSORs own seats must never be fed back, which is
  load-bearing in a pad because the resident writes into the buffer it reads; kPayloadMax 496 so
  a Delta stays 512 bytes on the ring; and the lane string being train-equals-serve, so lane
  naming is not a UI decision.
- What is actually left: the editor shell (the only large new piece), changeset.cpp with
  Etherpad vectors as the selftest oracle, PadSource, and the emit path with floor control and
  the forming region. fusord loop, segmenter, seat, seed, tape: lifted verbatim.
